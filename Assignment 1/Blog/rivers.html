    <div><u>The Ganges Of The South</u>Situated in the district of Coorg, the Kaveri River or Cauvery is the largest river in Karnataka. Known to devout Hindus as Dakshina Ganga (the Ganges of the South), it is considered holy and sacred. The origin of the river is a famous pilgrimage spot Talakaveri which is nestled amidst the Brahmagiri Hills in Coorg.
